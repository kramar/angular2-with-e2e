# Fork of Angular QuickStart Source with simple component and e2e test

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Here are the test related scripts:
* `npm run e2e` - compiles and run protractor e2e tests, written in Typescript (*e2e-spec.ts)

### End-to-end (E2E) Tests

E2E tests are in the `e2e` directory, side by side with the `src` folder.
Their filenames must end in `.e2e-spec.ts`.

Look for the example `e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts`.
Add more `.e2e-spec.js` files as you wish (although one usually suffices for small projects);
we configured Protractor to find them.

Thereafter, run them with `npm run e2e`.

That command first compiles, then simultaneously starts the `lite-server` at `localhost:8080`
and launches Protractor.  

The pass/fail test results appear at the bottom of the terminal window.
A custom reporter (see `protractor.config.js`) generates a  `./_test-output/protractor-results.txt` file
which is easier to read; this file is excluded from source control.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
